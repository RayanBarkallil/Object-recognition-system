In this project we tried to to implement a web application for recognizing objects using 
the CIFAR-100 Dataset and based on python and its libraries: Tensorflow, Keras, OpenCV and by using deep learning, 
in particular Residual neural network and in particular the Resnet-50 architecture.
We implemented our web application using Flask, HTML, CSS, Jquery.
